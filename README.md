# PFIwebsite
## My project is the website for The Platypus Film Institute. It is a fictional club for film enthusiasts. 
## My goals were: 
- To meet the project requirements  
- To design a website that had personality 
- to feel like I was designing a website for a real, existing organization. 

### Requirements
1. CSS uses Bootstrap: The Navbar is a Bootstrap Navbar 
2. CSS nav menu that collapses: The navbar starts with a hamburger and expands into individual nav links. 
3. Javascript validate form: "The Become a Platypus" page's sign-up form: 
    - Validates blank fields 
    - Confirms that the same password is entered twice 
    - Uses the "Platypus Name" field in an alert to confirm that the form has been submited.
4. Javascript create a function that uses math: The random movie recommendation button on index.html uses mathRandom and mathFloor to choose a random movie from an array and displays it in a text field.
5. Javascript set 3 varibles: The loop that validates the signup form sets and uses 6 varibles, the PFIlist sorter also sets and uses multiple varibles.
6. Javascript show/hide content: The PFI list sorter displays and sorts previously hidden divs.
7. Javascript show/hide content: The sign in button on the index opens a Modal.
8. Javascript create array: Created Movie array to store movies for the random recommendation button.
