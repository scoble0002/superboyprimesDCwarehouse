# Superboy Prime's DC Warehouse
## My project is a homepage for fictional DC comics villian Superboy Prime.
## My goals were: 
- To meet the project requirements  
- To design a website that reflected the personality of my client (Superboy Prime). 
- My personal goal was to push my Javascript past anything I did with my Front-end project. 

### Requirements
- Github: My project is on Github and has 28 commits.
- Responsive design: I use media queries to change my layout.
- Responsive design: My Navbar is a bootstrap navbar that collapses ino a hamburger menu.
- Retrieve Data: I use AJAX and Font Awesome to retrieve and diplay the social media logos for the contact us links.
- Create an Array and display a value: I created an array of images that uses math random to display one of two images in the navbar, on load.
- Create an Array and display a value: I created a sliding piece picture puzzle using a multidiminsional array to take an image and break it into tiles that are then positioned with x/y coordinates.
- Create a function that accepts two values and does a calculaton: puzzle.js has functions setupBoard(), drawTiles(),position, slideTile and solvedPuzzle() that meet this requirement.
- Create a function that accepts two values and does a calculaton: main.js has filterSelection(), pfiaddClass(), and pfiremoveClass() that meet this requirement.
- Create a function that accepts two values and does a calculaton: randomImage.js randomImage() also meets this requirement.
- Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format: The signup form does this for both the email and password field.
- Calculate and display data based on an external factor: I have a countdown to the Grand Openning of the physical srore on the index page.
